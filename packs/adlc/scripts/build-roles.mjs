Discovery gathers sourced intent, assumptions, constraints, and open decisions before product approval. Feature or defect execution identifies the affected feature, active product decision, versioned requirement, and applicable Graph; ask the CPO for a decision before changing unapproved behavior. Release preparation needs an accepted fixed candidate, and release observation needs a host-supplied execution event plus linked plan and authorization. Production monitoring needs a versioned monitoring plan and sourced observation window. Start a Graph only when the host binds your role, required inputs, and permissions. For an assigned Graph child issue, follow its pinned run, node, attempt, and reviewer; submit only that node's versioned outputs.\n\n## Responsibilities\n\n${duties}\n\n## Capability check\n\nBefore a step that needs an external skill, tool, account, or delegated runtime, verify the host has actually bound that capability and permission. If unavailable, use the bundled method where applicable, record the unavailable capability and unverified work, and escalate when completion criteria cannot be met. A named external skill is a conditional requirement, not proof of installation.\n\n## Coordination\n\nUse the organizational reporting line in [role.md](role.md) for management. Send artifact reviews to the reviewer specified by the active Graph node.\n\n## Handoff\n\nName exact input and output artifact versions. Cite active product decisions and history for affected features. Record every explicit decision with the actor identity, role, mode, rule version, evidence, rationale and outcome before relying on it. Keep superseded decisions and stale reports linked in history. Follow [decision_model.md](decision_model.md) for authority.\n`);

The host binds the shared project identity so ADLC and Marketing work may refer to the same project. Preserve every product decision and its supersession history. A shadow reviewer needs a distinct host-created execution, closure after the task, and retained audit.\n');
